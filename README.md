# TrackYourself

## What Is it?
A web based application that uses Firebase to track and store train information for a train station with Firebase.
The categories of information include:
      
Train Time (what time the first train will get there)

Destination Name

Frequency (how often that train arrives at the station, in minutes) 

Next Arrival (what time the next train will get there)

Minutes Away (how many minutes it will take for the next train to get to the station)

## How Does it Work?
The application is hosted on GitHub Pages, click [HERE](https://geeuho.github.io/TrainScheduler/) to access it.

Once you are on the page, you can create a new train entry by inputting the requested input boxes. 
These are:

Train Name

Destination Name

First Train Time 

Frequency

### You must enter all information in order for new train information to be inputted to firebase.

## Under the hood
The application was created using HTML, Bootstrap for CSS, and JavaScript.

The database requirements for new train data entry was done using the Firebase website.
